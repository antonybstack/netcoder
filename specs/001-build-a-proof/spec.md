# Feature Specification: Interactive C# 13 Code Execution PoC (Backend-first)

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-proof`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a proof of concept, where the angular frontend client has a code editor interface for writing the latest version of C# 13 code, which can send the code to a back .net 9 backend API that will compile and build this code, execute it, and return the output. For example, the user should be able to write Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");, which the server will return the output Hello, world!, and the client should be displayed this output. Do a backend first approach."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:

   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28

- Q: Choose the execution sandbox policy for user-submitted code in this PoC. ‚Üí A: No security restrictions
- Q: Set the execution timeout per run. ‚Üí A: 10 seconds
- Q: Set maximum code submission size. ‚Üí A: 1 MB
- Q: Set maximum captured output size before truncation. ‚Üí A: 1 MB

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a prospective user evaluating the platform, I want to type a short C# 13 snippet in a browser and run it, so I can immediately see the program output returned from the server.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the code editor is visible with an empty (or example) snippet, **When** the user enters `Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");` and selects Run, **Then** the output panel displays `Hello, world!` and indicates the run completed successfully.
2. **Given** the editor contains invalid code with a syntax error (e.g., missing `;`), **When** the user selects Run, **Then** the system returns a clear compile-time error including a message and the approximate location in the submitted code.
3. **Given** the submitted code never terminates (e.g., an infinite loop), **When** the user selects Run, **Then** execution is stopped after a 10-second timeout and a timeout message is shown.
4. **Given** the server cannot be reached, **When** the user selects Run, **Then** the UI shows a network error and provides a way to retry.
5. **Given** the output produced by the code is very long, **When** the user selects Run, **Then** the output is truncated after 1 MB and the UI indicates truncation.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the submission is empty or whitespace? ‚Üí The system rejects it with a clear validation error.
- How does the system handle very large submissions? ‚Üí The system enforces a maximum code size of 1 MB and returns a validation error when exceeded.
- Dangerous operations (filesystem, network, process spawning) are allowed in this PoC; user code runs without sandbox restrictions; intended for trusted internal use only.
- Multiple runs may be in-flight from the same user; unlimited concurrency allowed; throttling deferred.
- Outputs from prior runs: Retain all results in client memory for the current browser session; display newest first; provide a "Clear History" action to empty the list; the list resets on page reload.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to enter and edit C# code in a browser.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to initiate execution of the entered code via a clear control (e.g., Run button or shortcut).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST submit the code to the server and return the program's standard output and standard error.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support C# 13 language features and .NET 9 runtime semantics for this proof of concept.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST surface compile-time diagnostics (errors and warnings) with messages and approximate locations within the submitted code.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST enforce a 10-second execution time limit for each run and report a timeout outcome when exceeded.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST clearly differentiate outcomes: Success, Compile Error, Runtime Error, Timeout, and Network/Error states.
- **FR-008**: The UI MUST display execution state (e.g., running/progress). Concurrent submissions are allowed.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST validate requests and reject empty or oversized submissions (max 1 MB) with actionable messages.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST not persist user-submitted code or outputs on the server. For the current browser session, the UI MUST retain all execution results in client memory with no imposed limit; users MUST be able to clear the history via an explicit "Clear History" control, and the history MUST reset on page reload.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST isolate each execution so that outputs and errors from different runs do not intermingle.
- **FR-012**: The system SHOULD include a helpful default example snippet visible on first load (e.g. `Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");`).
- **FR-013**: The system SHOULD return execution duration and any truncation indicators with the result.
- **FR-014**: The system SHOULD limit output size to 1 MB and truncate with a clear notice when the limit is reached.
- **FR-015**: The system SHOULD only provide basic observability in development logs using the native logging solution to aid troubleshooting.
- **FR-016**: The PoC SHALL be accessible via localhost in a development environment; no public deployment required.
- **FR-017**: The PoC SHALL have no authentication/authorization and no sandbox restrictions; intended for trusted internal use only; not suitable for untrusted/public access.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Code Submission**: A user-provided code snippet (text), client/session context, submission time, and validation results. Not persisted in the PoC.
- **Execution Result**: Outcome type (Success | CompileError | RuntimeError | Timeout), stdout, stderr, diagnostics (list), duration, truncation flag.
- **Policy Constraints**: Execution timeout: 10 seconds; maximum submission size: 1 MB; maximum output size: 1 MB; per-client concurrency: unlimited (throttling deferred); used to validate and control runs.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# 13 (server-side execution), .NET 9 runtime; Browser-based UI built with a modern web framework already present in the repo (frontend).  
**Primary Dependencies**: Monaco Editor (latest) for the UI code editor; server-side compilation/execution mechanism selection remains abstract for PoC planning.  
**Storage**: N/A for PoC (no persistence of code or results).  
**Testing**: Backend unit and integration tests for compile errors and success cases.
**Target Platform**: Web client with a server process capable of compiling and executing C# 13 code.  
**Project Type**: Web (client-server).  
**Performance Goals**: For the canonical "Hello, world!" run, end-to-end time (submit ‚Üí output displayed) p95 ‚â§ 2s on a developer machine.  
**Constraints**: Execution timeout = 10s; output limit = 1 MB; submission size ‚â§ 1 MB; per-client concurrency: unlimited (throttling deferred); Security posture: no sandbox restrictions; trusted internal-only; not for public exposure.  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user demo and small group evaluation; not intended for production scale. Concurrency expectations resolved.  
**Deployment / Environments**: For PoC, target localhost development environment first. Production deployment is done through docker-compose and on a separate port.
