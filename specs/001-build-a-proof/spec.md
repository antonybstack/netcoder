# Feature Specification: POC – Web code editor that runs user C# code on a server and returns console output

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-proof`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a proof of concept, where the angular frontend client has a code editor interface for writing the latest version of C# 13 code, which can send the code to a back .net 9 backend API that will compile and build this code, execute it, and return the output. For example, the user should be able to write `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");`, which the server will return the output `Hello, world!`, and the client should be displayed this output."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: What security policy should apply to user code in this POC? → A: Moderate: allow temp dir file I/O; no network; no process spawn; time/memory limits.
- Q: What execution timeout should apply to user code? → A: 10 seconds
- Q: What memory limit should apply during compile and run? → A: 256 MB
- Q: How should attempts to read from standard input be handled? → A: Allow submission; server returns standardized “input not supported” error
- Q: What maximum output size should be returned before truncation? → A: 1 MB

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user, I can type C# code into a code editor in the web app and click a Run control to send my code to the server, so that I can see the console output or any errors returned and decide how to revise my code.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the app is loaded and the editor shows sample C# code using top-level statements, When I click Run, Then the output area shows the console output returned by the server (e.g., "Hello, world!") without requiring a page reload.
2. Given I enter syntactically invalid C# code, When I click Run, Then an error panel displays compile errors returned by the server including message text and a reference to the relevant line/column when available, and the UI remains responsive.
3. Given my code compiles but throws a runtime exception, When I click Run, Then the output area shows the exception information returned by the server (message and type; stack trace if available/allowed) distinctly from normal output.
4. Given my code runs longer than the allowed time limit, When I click Run, Then the server aborts execution and returns a timeout indication, and the client displays a clear timeout message.

### Edge Cases

- Infinite loops or long-running tasks exceed the 10-second time limit → execution terminated with a timeout indication.
- Programs exceeding the 256 MB memory limit → execution terminated with an out-of-memory indication.
- Console input operations (e.g., `Console.ReadLine`) → allowed to submit; server returns a standardized "input not supported" error shape and the client displays it distinctly from compile/runtime errors.
- Excessive output size (> 1 MB combined stdout+stderr) → output is truncated with an indicator of truncation.
- File I/O outside the sandboxed temp directory, any network access, or process spawning → return a clear "operation not permitted" outcome under the defined security policy.
- Multiple files, external packages, or project references are not supported in the POC; only a single source input is executed.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The client MUST provide an editable text area suitable for entering C# source code.
- **FR-002**: The client MUST provide a control to submit the current code for execution and a separate control to clear/reset the editor to a sample snippet.
- **FR-003**: The client MUST show server responses in a dedicated output area, distinguishing normal output, compile errors, runtime errors, and timeouts.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support the latest C# syntax as of the time of delivery, including top-level statements (e.g., `Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");`).
- **FR-005**: Upon submission, the system MUST compile the provided code and, if successful, execute it, returning a structured result including: success flag, stdout, stderr, error type (compile/runtime/timeout), and duration.
- **FR-006**: If compilation fails, the system MUST return compile diagnostics (message text and line/column when available) without attempting execution.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST enforce a 10-second execution time limit to prevent runaway programs.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST enforce output limits: maximum 1 MB combined stdout+stderr per run; responses MUST indicate when truncation occurs.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST enforce a moderate sandbox security policy: allow file I/O only within a sandboxed temporary directory; disallow all network access; disallow spawning external processes; enforce time and memory limits.
- **FR-010**: Submissions that attempt to read from standard input MUST be accepted, and the server MUST return a standardized "input not supported" error response shape that the client renders distinctly.
- **FR-011**: The system SHOULD return deterministic, consistent error shapes so the client can render states reliably.
- **FR-012**: The client MUST preserve the most recent output until the next run or until the user clears it.
- **FR-013**: The client MUST initialize with a default example snippet that produces visible output when run (e.g., Hello world).
- **FR-014**: The system MUST support Unicode characters in both source and output (e.g., emojis, non-Latin scripts).
- **FR-015**: The system MUST apply basic request rate limits or other safeguards to prevent abuse of the run endpoint in the POC. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rate limit policy]
- **FR-016**: If the server encounters an internal failure, it MUST return an error response that the client displays distinctly from user code failures.
- **FR-017**: The POC MUST operate statelessly; no persistent storage of user code or results is required.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST enforce a memory usage limit of 256 MB during compilation and execution.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **CodeSubmission**: Represents a single request to compile/execute code. Attributes: `source` (string), `language` (fixed to C# for this POC), optional `options` (e.g., optimization, target), `requestId` (client-generated or server-generated).
- **RunResult**: Represents the response for a submission. Attributes: `success` (bool), `phase` (compile|run|timeout|error), `stdout` (string), `stderr` (string), `diagnostics` (list of {message, severity, line, column}), `exception` (optional {type, message, stack?}), `truncated` (bool), `durationMs` (number), `requestId` (string).
